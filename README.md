User Profile:
The target user for this project is a recruiter, employer, or professor who is evaluating candidates for professional or academic positions. This person wants to quickly understand who I am, what skills I possess, and what professional experience I have. They value clarity, conciseness, and visual balance in digital portfolios. The website is designed for users who prefer to explore an online CV rather than a static document, allowing them to immediately grasp my strengths and background through an engaging interface. The ideal user appreciates both professionalism and creativity; they expect to see organized sections, clean typography, and an aesthetic that reflects the candidate’s personality. They are likely to access the page from a desktop device, but the responsive layout ensures a comfortable experience on tablets and laptops as well. Overall, this user persona is someone who seeks efficiency and good design — someone who will remember a candidate not only by their experience but also by how clearly and originally it was presented.

Information Architecture:
The website follows a single-page layout organized into four main areas: the Header, About Me, Experience, and Contact sections. The header introduces my name and the project title “Curriculum,” immediately establishing the site’s theme and tone through a strong background image. The “About Me” section contains a short personal description that summarizes my motivation, interests, and goals as a creative and tech-oriented individual. Below it, a dedicated “Languages” subsection lists the languages I speak — Spanish, Catalan, and English — which reinforces my communication skills and international profile. The next part, “Experience,” showcases two professional experiences: my time at Laboratorios Neftis and my current position as a Private Teacher. Each job entry combines images and text in alternating alignments to maintain a dynamic rhythm. The last section, “Contact Information,” includes my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub, giving recruiters an easy way to reach me. The structure ensures smooth vertical navigation, with visual consistency and clear content hierarchy that guides the user naturally from introduction to contact.

Visual Design:
The visual design of the project is inspired by the distinctive style of the Persona 5 video game interface, known for its bold contrasts, dynamic layouts, and expressive red-and-black color palette. The website uses #121212 as the main background color, complemented by #1a1a1a for secondary sections to create visual depth. The vibrant red #E60012 serves as the accent color for borders, highlights, and text emphasis, while #FFFFFF (white) ensures readability and balance. This combination of strong contrast and vivid red details gives the website energy and personality without compromising professionalism. The chosen typography, Bebas Neue, provides a modern and geometric aesthetic that fits well with the Persona 5 theme, while uppercase text reinforces consistency and impact. Layout-wise, the design employs diagonal section dividers, text shadows, and subtle image rotations to add motion and dynamism. Interactive elements such as hover animations on links and language items enhance engagement. Overall, the visual identity aims to project confidence, creativity, and structure — reflecting my personal approach to design and technology.
